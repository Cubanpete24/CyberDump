    "description":"While installed on a Cyberdeck, a Backup Drive \"saves\" Non-Black ICE Attacker, Defender, or Booster Programs that are destroyed by pulling them into the Backup Drive the instant before they meet their end. As a Meat Action, a Netrunner can re-install all Programs \"saved\" by the Backup Drive onto their deck, if they have the Slots for them. If removed from a Cyberdeck, the Backup Drive erases its contents automatically. Restored Programs with once-per-Netrun restrictions and the like are restored in the exact state they were saved in, so you can't kill your own Armor to refresh it. Yeah, that means you.
